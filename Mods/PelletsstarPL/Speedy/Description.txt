Speedy is a sub-mod of [[Magix]]. It allows you to not only pause, speed x1, and speed x30, which are the vanilla options for game speed, but also adds a new button with which you can pick the speed you want.

Note by Moxievision:<br>
I found a glitch in the mod where if you set the speed too high and hit space to pause, the speed up time thing goes up at the rate you set it to
