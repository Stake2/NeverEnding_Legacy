"Mod is dedicated to '''data.js''' (default dataset) since Magix has this content itself. You just need to paste these two links below data.js line. Adds some new ores to mine... And that's it, just new ores, some techs related to them. The "Fix" mod is to make rocky substrate actually have new ores in it."
