Installation:

Beta (broken) release:

In order to play with Magix, click the blue button on the top right that says in white lettering "Use Mods", then delete the line(s) of code that exist there ("[Data.js]" along with any other mod that has been previously installed).
Once removed, replace the code with these two links below (Paste both links. Order is important, so do not change it):

Data.js: https://orteil.dashnet.org/legacy/data.js

https://file.garden/Xbm-ilapeDSxWf1b/MagixUtilsR55B.js
https://file.garden/Xbm-ilapeDSxWf1b/MagixOfficialR55B.js

Local folder:
"/Broken version (don't use)/"

Please be aware that the links above are official but broken (with some issues completely freezing the game).
For example, obtaining some traits will freeze the game.
In particular, the game will break using the links above if you obtain the Bookwriting tech once the game ticks to the next year.

Previous Release:

The links below may be able to load the mod.
However, using these links have been known to freeze the game even more than the other ones, so it is not recommended to use them.

If you wish to add any other mods alongside Magix, please research to make sure the mod you wish to add is compatible with Magix.
Some examples of compatible mods are the [Market Mod], [Speedy Mod], and [Extra Ores].
If the mod is compatible, make sure it is added after the Magix mod file.
Otherwise, you may get an error message (there are some cases where this works correctly, however).
